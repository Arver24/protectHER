sorry i just cant proceed anymore, need a break

This project “protectHER” has been developed during HACK36 by the team of four first year B.tech (CSE) students from MNNIT Allahabad.
The Problem
Attack Type assaults:  Acid attack, Rape, Trafficking by Kidnapping, Abduction, Sexual Assaults, Chain Snatching,
Domestic violence: dowry deaths, cruelty by husbands and relatives, 
Cyber Crimes: 
Others: Eve Teasing, 

Solution : protectHER
protectHER is an app …. Blah blah 
Name explained : protectHER
The name protectHER reflects our views about the problem “she” faces. We believe that a women’s safety is not limited to just that lady and few of her closed ones, instead everyone is equally responsible for her safety. The name protectHER hence represents US asking you all, irrespective of your genders, to protect her.
Target Users
Everyone : as the name suggests, even if you are not the victim of an assault, you should be able to use this app to help others.
Specially focused towards children of ages 9-19 who are relatively less mature but equally prone to any such crimes.
In most cases, child of such ages aren’t even aware of what is right and what is wrong. So, their awareness is the key here.

What we AIM to achieve with protectHER?
protectHER is not limited to being an SOS button App that sends your location when triggered. Any App or technology can not be a solution to a problem that exist in some rotten minds. However, technology can help us fight and protect ourselves and others against such crimes. That’s why protectHER is a way to remind us all the responsibilities that we have as a part of the society, to protect her.
Our Story in Hack36 : TheDebuggers
Why this project?
One might ask, there are plenty of apps that come when I search “woman safety” on play store. Then why protectHER?
The apps on the play store are mostly just frontend and some of their SOS buttons don’t even work. And some apps which have a working SOS, are not fully free to use. Overall we can see why they have so fewer downloads even though the problem they are claiming to solve is highly frequent and global. This is one of the reason why we started with protectHER.
The other reasons are as explained above like :
Intended for everyone
Totally free to use
Not just an app
